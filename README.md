# Northview-Nav [iOS]

Northview Nav is an app development project created to allow new visitors to northview to have a simplified navigation experience.
The app implements indoor mapping and wayfinding features to overlay the school map on top of a map of the surrounding area, allowing for users to track their location within the building.

Northview Nav is built on Apple's new SwiftUI framework, introduced at WWDC 2019 in order to implement a modernized user interface that adapts to many devices. I also uses APIs from Indoor Atlas to manage wayfinding as well as overlay rendering on top of our maps.
